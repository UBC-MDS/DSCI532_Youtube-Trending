This panel allows the user to explore the level of engagement of trending videos across different categories on YouTube. The four options are: "Views", "Likes", "Dislikes" and "Comment Count". The graph is visualized as a boxplot in order to showcase the outliers and rough distribution of all these trending videos in their respective categories. Users can get a general feel for how much engagement is typically required to get a video on the frontpage of YouTube.

### Panel 2
#### Upload Times
<br>
The number of trending videos can be visualized by their upload times throughout the day. As we can see, popular content creators tend to upload videos in the late afternoon.

These trends can also be visualized by distinct categories. There are some variations across genre.

In addition of time of the day, users can observe trends through days of the week. Perhaps it is a little surprising, weekdays are a much busier time for popular content creators than the weekends.
